# Backend Management Interface PRD

## Executive Summary

The Backend Management Interface is a critical component of SnapStack that provides comprehensive business operations management, real-time monitoring, and administrative control. This internal-facing tool enables the team to monitor performance, manage content, analyze parser accuracy, track finances, and provide customer support.

## Problem Statement

Without a proper admin interface, the SnapStack team would be:
- Flying blind on business metrics and performance
- Unable to quickly diagnose and fix parser issues
- Missing critical API health monitoring
- Lacking tools for customer support
- Unable to track profitability by product/vendor
- Missing content management capabilities for curated stacks

## Solution Overview

A comprehensive React-based admin dashboard that provides:
1. Real-time business metrics and KPI monitoring
2. Interactive parser testing and improvement studio
3. Vendor API health monitoring and cost tracking
4. User management and support tools
5. Financial dashboard with profitability analysis
6. Content management system for curated stacks
7. System health monitoring and alerting
